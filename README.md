# Merge Sort

A Ruby merge sorting algorithm

#### Parameters

(Array of numbers)

#### Returns

Sorted array of numbers

## Problems

Use recursion to write a merge sort algorithm

1. Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted).
2. Repeatedly merge sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. This will be the sorted list.
